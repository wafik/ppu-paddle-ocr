# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `session.onSessionFallback` - a callback fired when session creation with the
  requested execution providers fails and the service retries on `cpu`/`wasm`.
  It receives the original error and runs after the fallback session is ready,
  so a host that manages its own accelerator ladder can see that acceleration
  was silently dropped instead of reading a log line. The option is stripped
  before the session options reach ONNX Runtime. Works on Node, web, and
  mobile.

### Added

- Opt-in mirror for the built-in model URLs. Set
  `PPU_PADDLE_OCR_MODEL_MIRROR=1` and a download that exhausts its retries on
  the primary host runs the whole sequence again against the GitHub copy of the
  models repo, which serves byte-identical files. Off by default: GitHub LFS
  bandwidth is a budget that, once spent, cuts off every version at once, so it
  suits places with bounded request volume such as CI. A model URL you supplied
  yourself is never rewritten.

- `detection.detectionThreshold` - binarizes the detector's probability map
  before text regions are extracted, which the detection path previously never
  did. Without it the map goes to `findContours` unmodified, and since that
  treats any non-zero pixel as foreground the effective cut sits around 0.002
  rather than at a level the caller picks. Setting `0.3` measured +1.46 points
  of character accuracy on the 40-stem SROIE2019 sample (83.51% -> 84.97%) for
  roughly 11% more engine time. Read that as that corpus' result, not a general
  gain: the option changes which boxes are detected, not how well they are read,
  and SROIE's tight ground-truth boxes reward ppu's box shrinking on their own.
  The default preset measured worse on `assets/receipt.jpg` (99.48% to 96.87%
  per-line). The extra time is not the cut, which costs 0.42 ms per image, but
  the crops: the cut shortens a box far more than it narrows it, raising the
  mean aspect ratio from 4.76 to 5.82, and recognition rescales to a fixed
  height, so wider crops are wider tensors. It is not PaddleOCR parity either -
  PaddleOCR pairs its 0.3 cut with a 0.6 box score and an unclip ratio of 1.5,
  and ppu has no unclip step. Off by default (`0` keeps today's behavior),
  applies to both the OpenCV and canvas-native engines, and rejects values
  outside `[0, 1)`.

### Fixed

- Model downloads honour a `Retry-After` header on a failed response, capped at
  60 seconds, and otherwise back off exponentially with jitter (0.5-1 s, then
  1-2 s) instead of the flat 500 ms / 1 s it used before. A rate-limited host
  knows how long its window has left; guessing shorter just burned an attempt.

### Changed

- Dev dependency: `adm-zip` override moves to `^0.6.1`. Version 0.6.0 follows
  symbolic links at the extraction destination (GHSA-vwc7-r8mq-g2x9, CVSS 6.8).
  It reaches the tree only through `onnxruntime-node`'s install script, so no
  published artifact was affected.

## [6.5.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Serve: request validation and the OpenAPI spec now come from valibot via
  `hono-openapi` instead of zod via `@hono/zod-openapi`. Routes, envelopes,
  `/openapi.json`, and `/docs` are unchanged apart from JSON Schema
  spelling (`const` for literals, no spurious `nullable`). One tightening:
  JSON bodies now require real numbers and booleans for `minimumConfidence`,
  `flatten`, `settle`, and `concurrency`; string forms are still accepted in
  multipart fields, where everything arrives as a string.

- **Test and CLI-binary runtime on ONNX Runtime 1.29.** `onnxruntime-node` and
  `onnxruntime-web` dev pins move from 1.27 to 1.29, so the standalone binaries
  embed 1.29. Accuracy on the reference receipt is identical across all six
  strategy/engine cases and per-image latency is unchanged (median within 2 ms
  on Apple M1). The peer ranges are untouched; npm users pick their own.
- Lint and format toolchain: oxlint and its plugin API to 1.82.0, oxfmt to
  0.67.0, with no formatting changes in the tree.
- **Git hooks moved from Husky and lint-staged to lefthook.** Same checks
  (staged-file formatting, lint, type-check, version lockstep, commit message
  format), declared in `lefthook.yml` with the two checks as small bun
  scripts. Formatting is now checked, not rewritten: an unformatted staged
  file fails the commit with a `bun run fmt:fix` hint, so a partially staged
  file never has its unstaged hunks swept into the commit. The first
  `bun install` after pulling resets Husky's `core.hooksPath`.

### Fixed

- Serve: malformed JSON on `/v1/ocr/batch`, `/stream`, and `/async` returns
  `400` in the error envelope instead of `500`.
- Per-box recognition in debug mode now runs through the same crop, rotate,
  and batched recognize helpers as the production path (as a batch of one),
  so turning `debugging.debug` on no longer changes the text. The debug path
  had its own copy that skipped vertical crop rotation and dropped per-call
  overrides.
- Serve: an allowlisted `https` source whose host cannot be reached (DNS, TLS,
  refused connection, or a redirect) now returns `502` with the host named,
  instead of `500 Internal server error`.

## [6.5.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- `recognize()` accepts per-call overrides for `minimumConfidence`,
  `spaceRecovery`, `rotateVerticalCrops`, and `recBatchSize` on Node, Bun,
  web, and React Native.
- One-shot `ocr()` and `detect()` functions on the Node/Bun, web, and React
  Native entry points. Each call initializes and destroys its own service;
  repeated work should continue to use `PaddleOcrService`.

### Changed

- Node, web, and React Native now share the same recognition and lifecycle
  implementation.
- `recognize()` skips the result cache when `strategy` or any per-call
  recognition override is set, since the cache is keyed on the image alone.
- **Tooling pinned to Bun 1.4.2.** CI workflows, the serve Docker images, and
  `@types/bun` move from 1.3.14 to 1.4.2 together. `bun run test` now runs the
  suite across two worker processes (`--parallel=2`), which cuts a local run
  from about 40 s to under 30 s on an 8-core machine. The serve app's
  `minimumConfidence` request field ships in serve 0.4.0.
- **Coverage badge.** CI uploads the lcov report to Codecov and the README
  carries the badge.

## [6.4.3] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- **Lint toolchain pinned to oxlint 1.79.0.** `oxlint` and `@oxlint/plugins`
  now carry the same exact version rather than a caret range and a pin, which
  had already drifted apart (1.77.0 against 1.74.0). The JS plugin API the
  vendored anti-slop rules load through is alpha and explicitly not covered by
  semver, so the two have to move together.

### Added

- **The web demo caches models in the browser.** They are stored by URL in
  IndexedDB after the first download and reused on later loads, so a reload no
  longer re-fetches tens of megabytes. A "Clear cached models" button in the
  configuration panel drops them. IndexedDB rather than the Cache API because
  Hugging Face redirects model requests to its CDN, and `Cache.put()` refuses a
  redirected response.

### Changed

- **Web demo: the sample images are a collapsible dock.** They sit in the
  bottom-left of the canvas panel and fold to a single chip once an image is
  loaded, so they stay reachable without covering the image.

### Fixed

- **Model downloads no longer send a referer.** Some hosts blocklist the origin
  of the page doing the embedding and answer with a status that carries no CORS
  headers, which the browser then reports as "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
  header is present" rather than as the block it is. A model download has no use
  for a referer, so the web fetches ask for `no-referrer`. This is what the demo
  needed a page header for; embedders now get it without knowing to set one.
  Node and Bun have no referer to send and are unaffected.
- **Web demo: switching sample images needed a page reload.** The sample chips
  were inside the placeholder element that gets hidden once an image loads, so
  choosing one sample hid the row offering the others.
- **Web demo: model load failures reported nothing useful.** A cross-origin
  failure surfaces as a bare `TypeError`, so the demo now re-asks in `no-cors`
  mode to tell "the server answered and the browser withheld it" from "the host
  was never reached", and keeps the prefetch's diagnosis instead of discarding
  it. It also drops the per-file `HEAD` probe, which was a second request and a
  second way to fail for a size each `GET` already reports, and retries a
  refused file against the GitHub original.
- **Web demo could not load models.** Hugging Face returns `404` for requests
  carrying a `*.workers.dev` referer, and a 404 response has no CORS headers,
  so the browser reported it as "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is
  present" rather than as the 404 it was. The demo is hosted on workers.dev, so
  every model fetch failed after the 6.4.2 move to the mirror. The page now
  sends `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, which nothing there needs. Only pages
  whose origin Hugging Face blocklists are affected; `pages.dev`, `vercel.app`,
  `netlify.app`, and localhost all serve normally, as do Node and Bun, which
  send no referer at all.

## [6.4.2] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- **Models now download from Hugging Face.** `MODEL_BASE_URL` and
  `DICT_BASE_URL` point at
  `https://huggingface.co/snowfluke/ppu-paddle-ocr-models/resolve/main`, a
  mirror of the models repo that serves from a CDN. The GitHub copies are
  behind a Git LFS bandwidth budget which, once exhausted, cuts off downloads
  for every published version at once; the LFS batch API on that repo is
  already refused. Paths are identical on both hosts, so a custom URL built
  from either base keeps working, and the GitHub copies stay in place for
  versions that reference them. Output is unchanged: the tiny preset fetched
  from each host produces byte-identical OCR results and the model files match
  by sha256.
- **Lint:** adopted the [anti-slop](https://github.com/dmmulroy/anti-slop)
  Oxlint rules, vendored under `tools/oxlint/anti-slop`. Ten rules are enforced;
  five are turned off with the conflict named in `.oxlintrc.json` (ONNX tensor
  `shape` naming, runtime environment probes, `unknown` at public boundaries,
  the option-tree dictionary contract, and conditional-spread optional fields).
  Type assertions in shipped code now carry a `SAFETY:` comment stating the
  invariant that makes them sound; test, bench, script, and example files are
  exempted. Anonymous object return types were replaced by named contracts
  (`ResizeDimensions`, `DecodedText`, `CropSource`, `MergedLineCrop`,
  `AsyncQueue`, and the serve envelopes), and a `str()` flag reader replaced
  twelve `as string | undefined` casts in the CLI. No behavior change: OCR
  output on the regression corpus is byte-identical.
- **Docs:** the README now points manual model URLs at the Hugging Face
  mirror (`https://huggingface.co/snowfluke/ppu-paddle-ocr-models/resolve/main`),
  which serves models and dictionaries from one base with no Git LFS
  bandwidth budget behind it. Paths are identical on both hosts. The
  library's own defaults still resolve from GitHub.

### Fixed

- **Debug mode changed OCR output.** The detected-box overlay was stroked onto
  the same canvas the recognition stage then read, so enabling
  `debugging.debug` altered the recognized text: box outlines fall in the gaps
  between words and swallowed the spaces. On the receipt sample the text went
  from 382 to 377 characters. The overlay is now drawn on a copy. Reported by
  @xirf in #101.
- **Debug dumps ignored an absolute `debugFolder`.** `CanvasToolkit.saveImage`
  joins its path onto `process.cwd()` unconditionally, so an absolute folder
  was created empty while the images were written to a path rebuilt under the
  working directory. Node now resolves the folder and writes the PNG itself,
  which also drops the toolkit's incrementing `0. ` filename prefix and the
  doubled `.png` on crop dumps. Reported by @xirf in #101.
- **A failed debug dump aborted detection.** Writing debug images is wrapped so
  a read-only filesystem returns boxes instead of an empty result. Reported by
  @xirf in #101.
- **Image cache keys collided on same-sized images.** `ImageCache.generateKey`
  hashed only the first 1024 bytes plus the length, so two images sharing a
  length and an opening run of uniform pixels got one key and the second call
  returned the first one's text. Canvas input reaches the cache as raw RGBA,
  where both conditions are ordinary. The key now samples across the whole
  buffer, endpoints included. Reported by @xirf in #102.
- **`buildBatchOptions` omitted `settle`.** The batch and stream commands set
  it themselves, so behavior is unchanged, but the exported builder now returns
  what the commands actually run with. Reported by @xirf in #103.
- **Model cache collisions.** The Node/Bun cache keyed entries on the file name
  alone, so two resources sharing a name (a custom model and a preset, or the
  same path on two hosts) served each other's bytes. Entries now sit under a
  digest of the full URL. Existing caches are not migrated: the first run after
  upgrading re-downloads, and the old flat files can be removed with
  `service.clearModelCache()`.

## [6.4.1] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **Faster OpenCV-engine pipeline on Node/Bun** (default engine): detection
  postprocessing builds its single-channel contour input Mat directly from
  the probability tensor instead of rendering it to a canvas and reading it
  back through `grayscale()`; recognition preprocessing reads the resized
  Mat's bytes directly instead of routing each crop through `toCanvas()` +
  `getImageData`. The CTC argmax loop also drops per-element nullish checks.
  Output is bit-identical on the regression samples (receipt accuracy
  unchanged at 99.74%/99.48%/94.26% across strategies); interleaved
  benchmarks show ~2-2.5% lower median `recognize()` latency on the OpenCV
  engine (detection postprocess -8%) and neutral on `canvas-native`.
- **Docs:** the README "CLI (global install)" and "Standalone Binaries"
  sections now lead with the command; the notes moved into collapsible
  sections. The CLI flag table is split into "Models and engine" and
  "Behavior and output".
- **Docs:** the README "Batch Recognition" section now opens with the basic
  call and a "you want / use" lookup table, with each variant behind a short
  labelled lead-in. The `"auto"` concurrency default on CPU is documented as
  `4` instead of "a small default".
- **Docs:** README "Main-Thread Usage" now documents `mainThreadYieldMs` as a
  value table, and states the yield cost per batched inference rather than per
  detected line (it is one pause per `recBatchSize` crops). "Multithreaded
  WASM" and "React Native" lead with the requirement; the JSR exclusion
  rationale moved into a collapsible note. The `wasmPaths` note is no longer a
  blockquote and shows the self-host assignment.
- **Docs:** README "Fine-Tuning on Your Data" splits the one-paragraph wall
  into what the starter kit covers, and points at Image Preprocessing first.
  Unwrapped the hard-wrapped PP-OCRv6 intro paragraph.

### Fixed

- **CLI:** `help` listed `v6-small` as the default preset; the default is
  `v6-tiny` (`DEFAULT_MODEL` in the model catalogue).
- **Docs:** removed leftover rebase conflict remnants that duplicated the CLI
  flag table and the `RecognitionOptions` table (README and the
  `skill-ppu-paddle-ocr` configuration reference), which broke their rendering
  on GitHub.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Standalone CLI binaries** for Linux x64/arm64, macOS Apple Silicon, and
  Windows x64, built with `bun build --compile` and attached to every GitHub
  release - no Node, Bun, or npm install required (models still download on
  first run). Each binary embeds ONNX Runtime's shared libraries and preloads
  them at startup so the native binding resolves inside the single-file
  executable. Distributed as `.tar.gz`/`.zip` archives (~50 MB download,
  ~140-200 MB extracted), each with a `-slim` variant that drops the OpenCV
  engine for ~28 MB less on disk (~5 MB less to download), pinned to
  `canvas-native` (rejects `--engine opencv` with a usage error). Binaries
  are smoke-tested on all four OS runners in CI, cosign-signed (Sigstore
  bundle attached per archive), and covered by GitHub build provenance
  attestations (`gh attestation verify`). Intel macOS and musl (Alpine) are
  not covered because onnxruntime ships no builds for them.

- **`recognition.mainThreadYieldMs` option** pauses before each recognition
  inference to yield the event loop. On the web main thread the `/web` entry
  defaults it to `10`, so a page running `recognize()` without a Web Worker
  keeps painting and handling input between WASM inference blocks instead of
  freezing for the whole image; consecutive `await`s alone only queue
  microtasks, which the renderer cannot interleave with. Defaults to `0`
  (disabled) in workers, Node, Bun, and React Native, and an explicit caller
  value always wins. Also exposed as `--main-thread-yield-ms` on the CLI. A
  Web Worker remains the recommended home for OCR; this closes the gap for
  script-tag/main-thread setups.
- **Batched recognition inference** (`recognition.recBatchSize`, default `6`,
  CLI `--rec-batch-size`): crops are width-sorted and stacked into one
  `[N, 3, 48, W]` tensor per chunk - one `session.run` per chunk instead of
  per crop. Each row decodes only its own share of the padded output
  sequence, and padding replicates the crop's edge pixels so convolution
  receptive fields never see a hard boundary. Benched ~35% faster with
  equal-or-better accuracy vs sequential on the reference receipt (per-line
  99.48% -> 99.48%, per-box 99.48% -> 99.74%). `1` restores the previous
  sequential behavior; fixed-batch models are detected and clamped to `1`
  automatically.
- **`recognition.rotateVerticalCrops`** (default `true`, CLI
  `--no-rotate-vertical-crops` to disable): crops with height/width >= 1.5
  rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise before recognition (upstream
  PaddleOCR's convention), so vertical text lines read correctly with no
  orientation model.
- **`recognition.spaceRecovery`** (default `false`, CLI `--space-recovery`):
  emits inter-word spaces the greedy CTC decode drops when the space class is
  a strong runner-up at a character timestep.
- README: a Document Correction section showing how to compose with
  ppu-doc-correction (page orientation, unwarping) instead of paying for
  orientation models inside the OCR path.

- **`recognition.maxCropSourceSideLength` option** (default `2000`) caps the
  longest side of the canvas recognition crops are cut from, independent of
  and above `detection.maxSideLength` (which only resizes the detector's own
  input tensor, never the recognition crop source). Previously, recognition
  always cropped from the full-resolution source canvas regardless of size -
  a source far larger than any normal photo (e.g. a 4961x7016 full-page scan)
  paid seconds of decode plus dozens of full-res per-line crop ops per image.
  The default of `2000` keeps ordinary photos (up to ~2000px) untouched with
  today's crop fidelity, and measured 2-4x faster on far-oversized images
  with no measurable accuracy loss on the fixture set. This is a
  speed/accuracy trade-off, not a one-size-fits-all fix: lower the value for
  more speed on large sources at some accuracy cost, or raise it to always
  crop at native resolution regardless of input size. Box coordinates are
  scaled back to original-image space in the returned results either way.
  Exposed as `--max-crop-source-side-length` on the CLI and as
  `MAX_CROP_SOURCE_SIDE_LENGTH` on `apps/serve`, keeping the documented 1:1
  option-to-flag mapping intact.

### Fixed

- Scaled recognition boxes now clamp to a 1px floor, so an aggressive
  `recognition.maxCropSourceSideLength` on a very large source cannot round a
  thin box to zero width/height and turn a degenerate crop into an empty
  result for the whole image.

### Security

- Removed `onnxruntime-react-native` from `devDependencies` (it remains an
  optional peer dependency, so consumers are unaffected). Its `react-native`
  peer dragged `metro` and `image-size` 1.2.1 into `bun.lock`; `image-size`
  carries two unfixed High denial-of-service advisories
  (GHSA-5p2g-fcmc-qvqq, GHSA-w3rx-r6r6-pgpr) with no patched release, which
  failed the SCA gate. The mobile entry now type-checks against a local
  ambient declaration re-exporting `onnxruntime-common`, matching the real
  package's own typings.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **`isWebWorker()` export on `ppu-paddle-ocr/web`** for host apps that need to
  branch on the scope themselves
- Recognition fine-tuning starter kit (`examples/fine-tune/`): per-tier
  PP-OCRv6 training configs, a dataset preparation script that builds
  train/val/test splits from images with line-level ground truth, and a
  sample dataset generated from the bundled receipt.

### Fixed

- **The web build runs inside a Web Worker** ([#84](https://github.com/PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/ppu-paddle-ocr/issues/84)).
  `createCanvas()` called `document.createElement("canvas")` and `isCanvas()`
  evaluated `image instanceof HTMLCanvasElement`, and neither global exists in a
  worker scope, so both threw a `ReferenceError`. Canvas creation now goes
  through `ppu-ocv`, which prefers `OffscreenCanvas`, and the canvas check is
  duck-typed. Manifest V3 extension service workers are covered by the same fix.
  No shims needed on the caller's side
- **`ort.env.wasm.wasmPaths` gets its CDN default inside workers too.** The
  default was gated on `typeof window !== "undefined"`, which is false in a
  worker, so CDN and unbundled worker setups 404ed on the WASM binaries
- **The default WASM CDN URL now tracks the loaded `onnxruntime-web`.** It was
  pinned to 1.26.0 while the package resolves 1.27.0, so anyone who did not set
  `wasmPaths` handed a 1.27 loader 1.26 binaries. The version is read from
  `ort.env.versions` at call time and can no longer drift

## [6.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- **Default model is PP-OCRv6 tiny** (was small): 2-4x faster, ~6 MB
  download instead of ~30 MB, and 99.48% vs 97.39% on the receipt
  benchmark. Tiny's dictionary covers ~6.9k characters; pass
  `model: V6_SMALL_MODEL` for the full 50+ language coverage
- **Default recognition strategy is `per-line`** (was `per-box`): line
  context reads short low-contrast labels more reliably and needs fewer
  inference calls. Applies to the library, CLI, serve, and playground
- **Default `minimumAreaThreshold` is 20** (was 50), so single-digit
  detections survive the area filter

### Added

- **`maxSideLength: "auto"` (new default)**: the detection cap scales with
  the input, `clamp(0.75 x longestSide, 960, 1920)`, replacing the fixed
  640 cap. Pass a number to pin a fixed cap
- **`minimumConfidence` recognition option (default 0.5)**: drops
  recognized items below the threshold (upstream PaddleOCR's
  `drop_score`); symbol-only items need an extra 0.3. Set 0 to disable
- **Decode-level text refinement**: fullwidth forms become ASCII on
  non-CJK text, doubled spaces collapse, and gap-based space injection is
  measured in each crop's own CTC timestep quantum so it adapts to any
  model's position grid
- **"Choosing a Model and Configuration" README section**: a selection
  matrix by model family and input characteristics, each recipe validated
  against a committed example image in `assets/config-matrix/`

### Fixed

- **`canvas-native` no longer drops weak detections the `opencv` engine
  keeps** (missed text on the web build): its binarization threshold now
  matches the OpenCV foreground criterion

## [6.1.2] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- **`per-line`/`cross-line` now hand each box its own text instead of dumping
  the whole line into the first box.** `mergeLineCrop` stitched same-line
  crops flush against each other, so the recognizer returned the line as one
  unspaced token and the word-based redistribution gave everything to the
  first box and empty strings to the rest. Merged crops now get a white
  separator gap between boxes (a word boundary the model can see), and
  recognized text maps back to boxes by each character's CTC timestep
  position - the decoder reports where in the crop every character fired,
  so each character lands in the box it was read from. Falls back to a
  width-proportional split (with cuts snapped to nearby spaces) when
  positions are unavailable. Fixes both the all-text-in-first-box symptom
  and cross-line batch splits bleeding characters between lines
  (e.g. `...AlbumsRe` / `centl`).
- **Spaces the model drops at wide gaps are restored.** CTC recognition
  under-emits spaces on columnar layouts (receipts, tab-aligned forms):
  `Total Item 1` came back as `Total Item1` even on a per-box crop. The
  decoder now inserts a space wherever the gap between two consecutive
  characters exceeds 2.5x the median glyph pitch, except between identical
  characters (CTC's mandatory blank inflates their gap, e.g. `44`).
  Receipt bench accuracy: per-box 96.61% -> 97.13%, per-line up to 97.13%,
  cross-line up to 98.17% (opencv engine).

### Added

- **Playground: model preset selector and warm-up option.** The Models
  section now lists every catalogue preset (`v6-small` ... `v3-mobile`);
  custom URLs override the chosen preset per file. A new checkbox runs the
  hidden warm-up inference after Apply Configuration, so the first real
  recognize on a freshly applied model is not paying WASM/WebGPU
  compilation cost.

## [6.1.1] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- README: added an Ecosystem section linking the sibling PPU libraries
  (ppu-ocv, ppu-pdf, ppu-doclayout, ppu-doc-correction,
  ppu-orientation-corrector, ppu-uniface, ppu-yolo-onnx-inference).
- **Playground mobile experience and recovery.** Small screens now use dedicated
  Configuration, Image, and Results views instead of one long stacked page. The
  configuration panel groups advanced settings, preserves edits made during
  asynchronous reloads, and reports incomplete model loads with a retry action.

### Fixed

- **Cloudflare playground now ships the complete browser build dependency tree.**
  Shared modules imported by `lib/web` are copied into the deployment, preventing
  local module MIME errors and unnecessary CDN fallback.
- **`per-line`/`cross-line` no longer crash on dense pages with thin detected
  regions ([#72](https://github.com/PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/ppu-paddle-ocr/issues/72)).**
  `mergeLineCrop` stretches every box on a line to the
  line's height; a degenerate box (an underline or table rule a few px tall)
  multiplied its width by that stretch and the merged canvas width could
  exceed the platform's maximum surface size, making `createCanvas` throw
  `Create skia surface failed`. The per-box stretch is now clamped (max 4x)
  and the merged width is capped at 16384px, shrinking proportionally when
  exceeded. `run()` also awaits the strategy result inside its try/catch, so
  a strategy failure degrades to an empty result instead of rejecting
  `recognize()`.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **`detect()` - detection-only inference.** Runs the detection model without
  recognition and returns the bounding boxes (`{ boxes: Box[] }`). Available on
  all entry points (Node/Bun, web, mobile) and as the CLI `detect` command and
  the serve app's `POST /v1/detect`. Per-call `DetectOptions` extends
  `DetectionOptions`, so every tuning field (`maxSideLength`,
  `minimumAreaThreshold`, paddings, `mean`, `stdDeviation`) can be overridden
  per call, plus:
  - `crop: true` returns each region PNG-encoded as `ArrayBuffer`,
    index-aligned with `boxes` (not supported on React Native - the Skia
    canvas has no encoder).
  - `saveCropsTo: "some/folder"` writes each crop as `crop_NNN.png` into the
    folder (Node/Bun only; ignored on web/mobile).

### Fixed

- **Install size back to ~45MB (was ~317MB since 5.7.1).** `onnxruntime-node` is no
  longer in `optionalDependencies`, so a plain `npm install ppu-paddle-ocr` stops
  pulling its ~258MB of all-platform native binaries. It stays an optional peer
  dependency: Node/Bun users install it explicitly alongside the package
  (`npm install ppu-paddle-ocr onnxruntime-node`); web/mobile/Deno installs no
  longer pay for it. The CLI now detects the missing backend and prints install
  instructions instead of a module resolution stack trace - zero-install runs
  become `npx -p onnxruntime-node -p ppu-paddle-ocr ppu-paddle-ocr <args>`.

### Changed

- Bumped `ppu-ocv` to `^4.0.0` (OpenCV 5.0 via `@techstark/opencv-js` 5.0.0). No API
  changes; `ImageProcessor.initRuntime()` handles the new Promise-based runtime init
  internally.
- Improve docs (README.md) readability
- Bumped dev dependencies (`oxfmt` 0.58, `oxlint` 1.73, `onnxruntime-*` 1.27,
  `fast-check` 4.9, `@napi-rs/canvas` 1.0.2, `lint-staged` 17.0.8, `tsx` 4.23).
  Refreshed GitHub Actions pins (`docker/login-action` v4.4.0,
  `github/codeql-action` v4.37.0).
- **Moved to TypeScript 7 (native).** `typescript@7` drops the
  `transpileDeclaration` JS API the build used, so `scripts/build.ts` now emits
  all declarations in one native `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` pass (output is
  byte-identical). The `@typescript/native-preview` (tsgo) dev dependency is
  gone - `type-check` uses the same native `tsc --noEmit`.
- **CI bun pin bumped from 1.2.23 to 1.3.14.** bun 1.2.23 on Linux can hang
  `@techstark/opencv-js` 5's Promise-based runtime init when the node and web
  entries load in the same process; 1.3.14 handles it, and the 1.3.13
  SIGILL-on-exit that originally forced the 1.2.23 pin no longer reproduces.
- **Fixed a test-suite bug that emptied all opencv-engine OCR when file order
  changed.** `tests/canvas-compatibility.test.ts` stubbed
  `ImageProcessor.initRuntime` with a no-op but its `afterAll` restore omitted
  the `value` in `defineProperty`, which keeps the stub in place - on runners
  whose filesystem ordered that file first (CI's ext4), OpenCV never
  initialized and every later opencv OCR silently returned empty results. The
  restore now puts the real `initRuntime` back.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- **Default models upgraded from PP-OCRv5 mobile (English) to PP-OCRv6 small (unified
  multilingual).** On first run after upgrading, the new v6 model files are downloaded and
  cached; previously cached v5 files remain on disk and are not removed.
  Pass `model: V5_EN_MOBILE_MODEL` to keep the previous behaviour without any other code
  changes.
- Version bumped to **6.0.0** to signal the default-model generation change and align with
  the upstream PP-OCRv6 release series. Existing options and API surface are fully backwards
  compatible.
- Bumped `ppu-ocv` to `^3.3.0` for its new `canvas-mobile` (Skia) entry, and added
  `onnxruntime-react-native` and `@shopify/react-native-skia` as optional peer dependencies
  (for the new mobile entry below).
- **Default recognition strategy changed from `per-line` to `per-box`.** On PP-OCRv6 small,
  `per-box` is the most accurate on the receipt benchmark (96.61% vs 95.56% for `per-line`)
  while the three strategies are within ~1% on speed for sparse pages. Set
  `recognition: { strategy: "per-line" }` (or `"cross-line"`) to cut inference calls on
  dense, multi-word-per-line documents.
- Improve OCR line grouping scalability by avoiding repeated average-height recomputation.

### Added

- **React Native support via a new `ppu-paddle-ocr/mobile` entry.** Runs the same OCR
  pipeline on iOS and Android using `onnxruntime-react-native` (native JSI) and
  `ppu-ocv/canvas-mobile` (Skia-backed canvas), mirroring the web entry's platform-provider
  pattern. Always uses the canvas-native engine (no OpenCV on RN); CPU inference by default
  with opt-in NNAPI/CoreML. Install with
  `npm install ppu-paddle-ocr onnxruntime-react-native @shopify/react-native-skia` and import
  from `ppu-paddle-ocr/mobile`. Requires a dev client / `expo prebuild` (not Expo Go). A
  runnable Expo example lives in a separate repo, `ppu-paddle-ocr-mobile-react-native-demo`.
  Closes #17.
- **Model catalogue** - 27 named preset constants covering PP-OCRv6 (`V6_SMALL_MODEL`,
  `V6_MEDIUM_MODEL`, `V6_TINY_MODEL`), PP-OCRv5 (English, server, multilingual, INT8),
  PP-OCRv4, and PP-OCRv3, each bundling detection + recognition + dictionary URLs. Use them
  to switch models with autocomplete instead of hand-writing URLs, e.g.
  `new PaddleOcrService({ model: V6_SMALL_MODEL })`. See `src/model-catalogue.ts` for the
  full list.
- `DEFAULT_MODEL` - points to the current default (PP-OCRv6 small). `DEFAULT_MODEL_URLS` is
  retained as a deprecated alias.
- `ModelUrls` type, plus `MODEL_BASE_URL` / `DICT_BASE_URL` constants, for building custom
  model configurations.
- **CLI `--model <preset>` flag** for selecting a catalogue preset by name (e.g. `v6-tiny`,
  `v5-thai-mobile`); the granular `--model-detection/-recognition/-dict` flags override parts
  of it. `models --json` lists the available preset keys. Backed by the new exported
  `MODEL_PRESETS` map and `ModelPreset` type.
- All catalogue exports are available from `ppu-paddle-ocr`, `ppu-paddle-ocr/web`, and
  `ppu-paddle-ocr/mobile`.

### Fixed

- **Model download timeout raised from 30 s to 300 s per attempt.** The PP-OCRv6 small
  models are ~30 MB combined (vs ~12 MB for PP-OCRv5 mobile), causing the previous
  30-second `AbortSignal.timeout` to fire on slower connections before the body finished
  downloading. The new default matches a conservative 1 Mb/s floor across three attempts.

## [5.8.3] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **Model downloads no longer hang on a stalled connection.** Both the Node
  (`fetchAndCacheResource`) and Web (`_loadResource`) model fetches used a bare
  `fetch()` with no timeout, so a stalled GitHub connection during
  `initialize()` would hang until the caller's timeout (and flaked CI). Both now
  go through a shared `fetchArrayBufferWithRetry` helper with a per-attempt
  abort deadline (30s) and bounded retries.
- **Restored the JSR score (regressed to 58% in 5.8.2).** Exposing
  `coi-serviceworker.js` as a JSR module export forced a plain-JS file to be
  treated as a scored entrypoint - JSR can't derive types from it, so it flagged
  the whole public API as using "slow types" and as missing module docs. The
  file is now removed from `jsr.json` `exports` but kept in the publish
  allowlist, so it still ships and is fetchable at its JSR file URL (and the npm
  `ppu-paddle-ocr/coi-serviceworker.js` export is unchanged) - it is simply no
  longer scored as a documented module.
- Documented every remaining exported symbol - the Node/Web service
  constructors and the Web `PaddleOcrService` public methods (`isInitialized`,
  `changeDetectionModel`, `changeRecognitionModel`, `changeTextDictionary`,
  `recognize`) - bringing `deno doc --lint` to zero `missing-jsdoc` (100%
  documented-symbol coverage).

## [5.8.2] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **JSR was missing the `coi-serviceworker.js` export.** The npm package exposed
  `ppu-paddle-ocr/coi-serviceworker.js`, but `jsr.json` declared neither the
  export nor the file in its publish allowlist, so the JSR build omitted it. Both
  are now added.

## [5.8.1] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Opt-in COOP/COEP service worker.** The package now ships
  `coi-serviceworker.js` and exposes it via the `ppu-paddle-ocr/coi-serviceworker.js`
  export. On static hosts that can't set headers (e.g. GitHub Pages), copy it to
  the served root and load it before anything else to unlock cross-origin
  isolation -> `SharedArrayBuffer` -> multithreaded WASM inference. Not registered
  automatically and not needed when WebGPU is used or headers are set
  server-side. See the README's "Multithreaded WASM" section.
- Update outdated link to Cloudflare deployment

## [5.8.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Signed release artifacts.** The publish workflow signs the published tarball
  keyless with cosign (Sigstore, via OIDC) and attaches the `.sigstore.json`
  bundle to the GitHub release, satisfying OpenSSF Scorecard's Signed-Releases
  check. Release tags are SSH-signed.
- **Reproducible-build verification.** CI builds twice and fails unless `lib/`
  is byte-identical; `docs/REPRODUCIBLE_BUILD.md` documents how to verify.
- **Fuzz testing (dynamic analysis).** `tests/fuzz.test.ts` uses `fast-check` to
  feed random and malformed input to the OCR decode boundary on every CI run.
- **300-line-of-code cap.** A `max-lines` oxlint rule (error, `.ts` only) caps
  files at 300 lines of code; documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Web OCR test coverage.** The `ppu-paddle-ocr/web` path runs under the test
  runner via an `@napi-rs/canvas` polyfill harness (`tests/web-canvas-polyfill.ts`).

### Changed

- **The whole suite runs in one `bun test`.** Bumped `ppu-ocv` to `^3.2.2` (its
  structural canvas/Mat detection) and isolated the web suite's platform, so the
  node, web, CLI, and `apps/serve` tests run in a single process - no split
  runner. Combined coverage ~94%, gated at 90% via `bunfig.toml`. Removed the
  `scripts/test.ts` / `scripts/coverage.ts` two-pass runner.
- **Service layer split under the 300-LOC cap.** The recognition, detection, and
  processor services were split into focused internal modules
  (`src/core/recognition/`, `src/core/detection/`, `src/processor/model-cache.ts`).
  Public class APIs are unchanged.
- **`type` over `interface`** is now a lint error; pre-commit formatting is
  scoped to staged files (no whole-repo reformat sweep).
- **`apps/serve`** bumped to 0.1.3 with `API_VERSION` synced.

### Fixed

- **Demo (`index.html`) pins an exact package version.** The `ppu-paddle-ocr@5`
  CDN range could resolve to a stale build; it now pins the released version.
- **`changeDetectionModel` / `changeRecognitionModel` used a disposed session.**
  Both the node and web services swapped the ONNX session at runtime without
  rebuilding the detector/recognitor, so the next `recognize()` failed with
  "Session already disposed". They now rebuild against the new session.

### Security

- **Supply-chain hardening.** All GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs,
  `npm publish` passes `--provenance`, and an OpenSSF Scorecard workflow
  publishes a supply-chain health score.
- **Published package runs no install scripts.** `scripts` (including `prepare`)
  and `devDependencies` are stripped from the published manifest, so an
  installed copy can execute no lifecycle code (`hasInstallScript: false`).
- **OpenSSF baseline + best practices.** CodeQL on every push/PR (least-privilege
  token), an osv-scanner SCA gate (CI and pre-release), a CycloneDX SBOM per
  release, per-file SPDX headers, and the supporting docs: `GOVERNANCE.md`,
  `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`, the
  release-verification / dependency / remediation / VEX policy in `SECURITY.md`,
  and a DCO sign-off requirement in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **`SECURITY.md`** documents the Socket "obfuscated code" alerts on
  `onnxruntime-web` / `@protobufjs/float` as false positives on minified and
  generated upstream artifacts.
- **LICENSE now ships in the npm tarball** (previously only the SPDX field
  traveled).

## [5.7.1] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **`bunx ppu-paddle-ocr` / `npx ppu-paddle-ocr` now work out of the box.** `onnxruntime-node` is an optional _peer_ dependency, which package managers never auto-install, so a zero-install CLI run crashed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: onnxruntime-node`. It is now also declared in `optionalDependencies`, so `bunx`/`npx` pull it automatically. SDK consumers are unaffected (the optional peer is still honored); web-only installs can skip it with `--no-optional`.

## [5.7.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **First-party CLI - `bunx ppu-paddle-ocr ...` / `npx ppu-paddle-ocr ...`.** Shipped as a `bin` in the package (no extra install), it covers the whole library surface: `recognize` (single image), `batch` and `stream` (globs or lists, with bounded concurrency), plus `download-models`, `clear-cache`, and `models`. Every `PaddleOptions` / `RecognizeOptions` field has a flag - `--strategy`, `--engine`, `--flatten`, `--model-detection/-recognition/-dict`, detection tuning (`--max-side-length`, `--mean`, `--std`, ...), `--execution-providers`, `--concurrency`, and output controls (`--json`, `--pretty`, `-o`, `-q`). Recognized text goes to stdout, progress/logs to stderr; exit codes are `0` success / `1` runtime error / `2` usage error. Uses the default v5 models unless overridden. Cross-runtime (Node and Bun); no new runtime dependencies (`node:util.parseArgs`).

## [5.6.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`apps/serve` - production-grade REST API** (Hono + Bun, dockerized). One warmed `PaddleOcrService` behind a bounded inference queue (429 backpressure, no OOM/VRAM blow-up), graceful shutdown, optional API-key auth, Prometheus `/metrics`, OpenAPI `/docs`. Endpoints: sync/batch/async/SSE OCR, task status/cancel, `/v1/models`, `/health`, `/ready`. Multi-stage CPU + CUDA Dockerfiles (models pre-baked, non-root), compose, and a release workflow that builds, slims (docker-slim), and pushes to ghcr.io. Standalone package - kept out of the library's install/publish path.

### Developer experience

- **Benchmarks now measure the shipped default models (v5).** `bench/batch.bench.ts` and `bench/profile.ts` hardcoded the stale v4 recognition model from `models/`; they now omit explicit model paths so every benchmark exercises the library default, matching `bench/index.bench.ts`. README benchmark numbers refreshed accordingly.
- **Tests now exercise the default models (v5) too.** `index.test.ts` (recognition behaviour + accuracy), `engine-parity.test.ts`, and `batch-recognize.test.ts` no longer pin the stale v4 recognition model; the explicit file-path / ArrayBuffer / buffer-release tests in `index.test.ts` keep loading a local file, since they verify the model-loading API itself.

## [5.5.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **`batchRecognize()` and `batchRecognizeStream()`** - run `recognize()` over an array or (async) iterable of images with bounded concurrency, so peak memory stays bounded regardless of batch size. Results are index-aligned to the inputs; supports per-item error isolation (`settle`), `AbortSignal` cancellation, and `onProgress`. Concurrency defaults to `"auto"` - `1` when an accelerator execution provider (CUDA/WebGPU) is configured, a small CPU default otherwise. Inherited by both the Node and Web builds. See the new "Batch Recognition" section in the README.

### Developer experience

- **Replaced mitata with a zero-dependency benchmark harness** (`bench/harness.ts`). mitata crashed intermittently on this suite; the harness measures in-process with `performance.now`, runs tasks round-robin across rounds so thermal/GC drift hits each equally, and reports the median plus optional peak RSS. Both `bench/index.bench.ts` and `bench/batch.bench.ts` use it. Removes the `mitata` devDependency.
- **Test files are now isolated in worker processes** via `bun test --parallel=N` (where N is the number of `*.test.ts` files under `tests/` and `private-tests/`). Sequential `bun test` on Bun 1.3.13 segfaulted when multiple test files each loaded `@techstark/opencv-js` together with the newly upgraded `@napi-rs/canvas@1.0.0` - an Emscripten/embind multi-load issue that previously surfaced as a recoverable warning under `@napi-rs/canvas@0.1.x`. The workaround is also ~2.4x faster (11s vs 26s on the local suite).
- **Upstream fix landed.** Bun 1.3.14 (likely via [oven-sh/bun#30412](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/30412)) no longer crashes on the same suite without the workaround. Tracking issue: [oven-sh/bun#30716](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/30716). The `--parallel=N` flag is kept anyway for the speedup and to protect contributors still on 1.3.13.
- **`bun.lock` is now committed.** Previously gitignored; now part of the repo so CI and contributors install the exact set the maintainers test against. Has no effect on the published package (the publish workflow only ships `./lib`).

## [5.4.4] - 2026-05-14

### Security

- **Prototype pollution fix in `deepMerge`** (`src/utils.ts`). The recursive merge used to walk every own-enumerable key of the source object without filtering, so a crafted input containing `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` could write through to `Object.prototype` and affect unrelated objects in the process. `deepMerge` now skips those three keys explicitly. Users who pass untrusted JSON into any options object should upgrade.

### Developer experience

- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` so npm dependencies and GitHub Actions are kept current automatically (weekly schedule).
- Hardened CI: tightened `permissions:` on the quality-check workflow.
- Bumped CI actions to current majors: `actions/checkout` v4 -> v6, `actions/setup-node` v4 -> v6, `oven-sh/setup-bun` v1 -> v2.
- Bumped `oxfmt` 0.48.0 -> 0.49.0 (dev dependency, formatter).

## [5.4.3] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Browser bundlers no longer need to alias `ppu-ocv/canvas`** ([#18](https://github.com/PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/ppu-paddle-ocr/issues/18)). Core services previously imported `ppu-ocv/canvas` (the Node variant) at module top level, which forced every browser consumer - including the `web` subpath - to alias or `pnpm patch` the specifier. Canvas access is now routed through `PlatformProvider.canvas` (`prepareCanvas` / `createProcessor` / `getToolkit`); `NodePlatformProvider` wires it to `ppu-ocv/canvas`, `WebPlatformProvider` wires it to `ppu-ocv/canvas-web`. Webpack / Vite / Next.js / esbuild consumers of `ppu-paddle-ocr/web` should now work out of the box.

### Developer experience

- New `CanvasOps<TCanvas>` type on `PlatformProvider` for platforms that want to plug in custom canvas backends.
- `core/base-{detection,recognition,paddle-ocr}.service.ts` no longer import `ppu-ocv/canvas` at runtime (type-only imports remain).
- Demo (`index.html`) refreshed: full config surface (recognition strategy, cross-line factor, mean/std-dev, execution provider) is now editable from the sidebar; sticky "Apply Configuration" button with dirty-state pulse; loading overlay during inference; paper-and-ink theme.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-05-10

### Performance

- **Safe execution provider fallback for Node.js**: Session creation now gracefully handles failures from preferred providers (CUDA, DirectML, TensorRT) by falling back to CPU. Prevents initialization crashes on systems without GPU acceleration.
- **Default to `.ort` models**: The library now defaults to using pre-optimized ONNX Runtime (`.ort`) models instead of standard ONNX files, providing **~5x faster cold start** time.
- **Parallel model loading**: Model file download and session creation now run concurrently during `initialize()`, further reducing initialization latency.

### Developer experience

- Added `src/core/session-factory.ts` with `createSession()` that encapsulates EP selection and fallback logic, making it reusable across Node.js environments.
- New tests in `tests/session-factory.test.ts` covering EP fallback scenarios.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **WebGPU execution provider** (web build). `PaddleOcrService` imported from `ppu-paddle-ocr/web` now probes `navigator.gpu` during `initialize()` and prefers `["webgpu", "wasm"]` when available, falling back silently to `["wasm"]` otherwise. WebGPU session creation that errors out (e.g. a model uses an op WebGPU does not support) triggers a transparent retry on WebAssembly. Typical speedup on Chrome/Edge with a compatible GPU is **2-5x faster recognition** with no code changes.
- `isWebGpuAvailable()` and `getDefaultWebExecutionProviders()` exported from `ppu-paddle-ocr/web` for conditional UI ("GPU-accelerated" indicators) and explicit provider selection.
- `examples/quantize-onnx.py` - helper script for producing INT8 dynamic quantized recognition models from the FP32 ONNX files in [ppu-paddle-ocr-models](https://github.com/PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/ppu-paddle-ocr-models). Quantizes `MatMul` / `Gemm` only (`Conv` is skipped because `ConvInteger` is not implemented in `onnxruntime-node`'s CPU backend). Typically 20-50% faster recognition on x86-64 CPUs with VNNI and on WebAssembly, with no measurable accuracy loss on the receipt sample.

### Changed

- Bumped internal `onnxruntime-web` CDN URL and the `ort.env.wasm.wasmPaths` default from 1.24.2 to 1.26.0 (so WebGPU is available out-of-the-box).

### Documentation

- README now documents the model-cache folder location per OS (macOS, Linux, Windows).
- New README section **"WebGPU Acceleration"** covering auto-detection, how to override the provider preference, and how to probe support from user code.
- New README section **"INT8 Quantized Recognition Models (advanced)"** with platform-specific guidance - explicitly calls out that INT8 is **slower** than FP32 on Apple Silicon, so users on macOS ARM64 should stick with FP32.

### Developer experience

- Pre-commit hook now runs `bun run fmt:fix` and `bun run lint:fix` across the whole repo before delegating strict lint + type-check to lint-staged, and restages the fixer output via `git add -u`. Commits land clean without a follow-up "fix: apply formatter" commit.
- `package.json` now has a `"prepare": "husky"` script so `bun install` reliably activates husky on fresh clones (previously missing, which is why hooks silently did nothing).
- GitHub issue templates (bug, accuracy, performance, install, feature, documentation) and a pull request template with What/Why/How sections.
- CI pinned to Bun 1.2.23 until the Bun 1.3.x test-runner SIGILL on exit is fixed upstream.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-05-09

### Performance

- **Detection preprocessing**: Replaced the OpenCV resize + separate padded-canvas step with a single `drawImage` that scales and places the image into the padded target in one call. Eliminates a `Mat <-> Canvas` round trip for the OpenCV engine; neutral for canvas-native.
- **Detection normalization hot loop**: Pre-computed `scale = 1/(255*std)` and `shift = mean/std` so each pixel costs one multiply + one subtract per channel instead of divide -> subtract -> multiply.
- **Recognition tensor creation**: `createImageTensorFromCanvas` now fills channel 0 once from the grayscale input and uses `Float32Array.copyWithin` to memcpy the block into channels 1 and 2, instead of writing each pixel three times.
- **CTC decoding**: Inlined the per-timestep argmax and character-append helpers, and replaced the per-character confidence array + final `reduce` with a running sum + count. Largest measurable gain in `cross-line` (longer CTC output sequences).

Net result on the M1 receipt benchmark (vs. v5.2.0, clean machine): 1-3.5% faster across all six (strategy x engine) variants, with identical recognition accuracy on every variant.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **Recognition strategies** (`recognition.strategy` option and per-call `recognize(..., { strategy })` override): Choose how detected boxes are fed into the recognition model. Each strategy works by cropping detected regions from the canvas and stitching them side-by-side before running inference, so the number of recognition inferences can be reduced.
  - `"per-box"` - each detected box produces one separate inference (previous behavior, most accurate).
  - `"per-line"` (default) - boxes on the same line are merged into a single crop and a single inference.
  - `"cross-line"` - short lines are bin-packed across batches to minimise total inference calls, improving throughput on images with many text regions.
- `RecognitionStrategy` type, `RecognitionOptions.strategy`, `RecognitionOptions.crossLineWidthFactor`, and `RecognizeOptions.strategy` in the public API.
- `PaddleOcrService.downloadModels()` static method to pre-download and cache the default model files (useful for CI/CD and warm-up).
- Multi-engine x multi-strategy benchmark suite under `bench/`.

### Changed

- **Default recognition strategy is `"per-line"`**: ~10% throughput improvement over `"per-box"` on typical receipts while keeping accuracy within 1 edit-distance. Users who need strict per-box behavior can pass `{ strategy: "per-box" }` per call or configure it at service creation.
- Migrated linting toolchain from Prettier/ESLint to [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter) + [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/).
- Updated internal documentation and README to describe the recognition strategies, including the strategy diagram.

### Fixed

- Benchmark memory accounting and output formatting.
- Several `oxlint` findings across `src/` and `examples/` (no behavior changes).

### Build / CI

- Added a GitHub Actions CI workflow and wired npm + jsr publishing to GitHub releases.
- Added husky pre-commit + lint-staged hooks for commit-message validation and automatic formatting.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **Performance regression fix**: Restored eager `ImageProcessor.initRuntime()` call during `initialize()` when using the OpenCV engine. In v5.0.0 this call was removed when OpenCV was dropped; v5.1.0 restored the OpenCV code path but not the runtime initialization, causing the OpenCV WASM module to be lazily compiled on first use - resulting in 3-6x slower first inference and high variance in subsequent calls.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Processing engine selection** (`processing.engine` option): Choose between `"opencv"` (default) and `"canvas-native"` for the image preprocessing pipeline.
- `ProcessingEngine` type, `ProcessingOptions` interface, `DEFAULT_PROCESSING_ENGINE` and `DEFAULT_PROCESSING_OPTIONS` exports.
- Engine parity regression tests (`tests/engine-parity.test.ts`) to detect divergence between the two engines.

### Changed

- **Default processing engine restored to OpenCV**: v5.0.0 switched entirely to canvas-native processing, which caused regressions in bounding box accuracy for some images (boxes appearing ~8px narrower). The default is now `"opencv"` again, matching v4 behavior. Users who prefer the lighter canvas-native engine can still opt in via `processing: { engine: "canvas-native" }`.
- `BaseDetectionService` and `BaseRecognitionService` now accept an `engine` parameter to dynamically select the processing backend.
- Node `DetectionService` / `RecognitionService` constructors accept an optional `engine` parameter.
- Web services always use `canvas-native` (no OpenCV available in browser).

### Fixed

- Fixed bounding box width regression (issue [#8](https://github.com/PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/ppu-paddle-ocr/issues/8)) where canvas-native `findRegions` produced narrower boxes compared to OpenCV `findContours`.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Removed deskew functionality**: The `autoDeskew` option and `deskewImage()` method have been removed from ppu-paddle-ocr
- Deskew functionality has been moved to [ppu-ocv](https://github.com/PT-Perkasa-Pilar-Utama/ppu-ocv) library
- Users who need image deskewing should now use `DeskewService` from `ppu-ocv`
- Canvas operation such as `resize`, `getContours`, `grayscale` are migrate from `opencv` to native canvas operation.

### Migration Guide

See the [Migration Guide](README.md#migration-guide-v4x-to-v50) in the README for detailed step-by-step instructions on upgrading from v4.x to v5.0.

### Removed

- `DetectionOptions.autoDeskew` option
- `PaddleOcrService.deskewImage()` method
- Internal deskew service implementations (`BaseDeskewService`, `DeskewService`, `DeskewServiceWeb`)
- Deskew example file
- Deskew-related tests

### Why This Change?

- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Deskewing is an image preprocessing operation, while ppu-paddle-ocr focuses specifically on OCR
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Users who don't need deskewing won't have to include that code in their bundles
- **More Flexibility**: ppu-ocv provides more advanced image processing capabilities beyond just deskewing, including grayscale conversion, thresholding, blurring, and more

### Dependencies

- Updated `ppu-ocv` to v3.0.0 (compatible with both v2 and v3)

### Documentation
